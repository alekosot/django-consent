Django consent
========================================

A Django app for managing permissions from the point of view of the user. A
website typically grants users permissions, but this is the inverse. A user
grants the website specific permissions - like the permission to update their
twitter status or send the user marketing emails.

The app has no requirements, but supports south for migrations.

Simply pip install django-consent and view the docs on read the docs.
